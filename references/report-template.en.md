## Three actions to take now

1. `...`
2. `...`
3. `...`

> At most 3 actions the user can take today. If evidence is insufficient, name the verification to add first; do not pad the list.

## Executive summary

- P0: `N`
- P1: `N`
- P2: `N`
- P3: `N`
- Overall decision: `ready to deploy / deploy after P0 and P1 are fixed / not ready`
- One-line risk: `...`

## P0 Will break on deployment day

| ID | Location | Problem | Impact | Recommendation | Verification | Confidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | `file:line` | ... | ... | ... | ... | verified / observed / inferred | Open |

## P1 Must be fixed before deployment

| ID | Location | Problem | Impact | Recommendation | Verification | Confidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-1 | `file:line` | ... | ... | ... | ... | verified / observed / inferred | Open |

## P2 Recommended before deployment

| ID | Location | Problem | Impact | Recommendation | Verification | Confidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-1 | `file:line` | ... | ... | ... | ... | verified / observed / inferred | Open |

## P3 Hygiene and maintainability

| ID | Location | Problem | Recommendation | Confidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P3-1 | `file:line` | ... | ... | verified / observed / inferred | Open |

## Verified with no issue
