# Release Signing and Download Verification

[中文](SIGNING.md) | **English**

Release artifacts use **OpenSSH Ed25519** signatures. Signature verification requires OpenSSH 8.1 or newer; when available, macOS and most Linux systems can verify them without installing GPG.

## SSH version requirements

`SHA256SUMS.sig` uses the OpenSSH SSHSIG format. `ssh-keygen -Y sign` and `ssh-keygen -Y verify` were introduced in **OpenSSH 8.1**; OpenSSH 8.0 and earlier do not provide these subcommands. The OpenSSH 8.1 release notes describe the feature as experimental, so use 8.2 or newer when practical. Source: [OpenSSH 8.1 release notes](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.1).

Check the version of the `ssh-keygen` that will actually run:

```bash
ssh -V
```

The output looks like `OpenSSH_9.5p2`. `ssh -V` normally writes to standard error; scripts can use `ssh -V 2>&1`.

| OpenSSH version | SHA256 check | SSHSIG signature verification | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Supported | Supported (experimental) | Works; upgrade to 8.2+ when practical |
| 8.2 and newer | Supported | Supported | Recommended |
| 8.0 and older | Supported | Not supported | Upgrade OpenSSH or use a trusted modern environment |

The version that matters is the installed OpenSSH, not the macOS release. Older macOS versions may bundle OpenSSH below 8.1, and Homebrew or manually installed versions can also differ, so do not infer support from the OS version alone.

### If you are below 8.1

In priority order:

1. **Upgrade OpenSSH**: upgrade to a supported macOS release, or install a newer OpenSSH from a trusted package manager. Run `ssh -V` again after upgrading.
2. **Verify in a trusted modern environment**: on another Mac, Linux machine, container, or CI runner with OpenSSH 8.1+, place the zip, `SHA256SUMS`, `SHA256SUMS.sig`, `allowed_signers`, and `release-signing-key.pub` in one directory and run the commands in this document. Copy only the release files; never obtain `ssh-keygen` from a third party.
3. **If you cannot upgrade and have no trusted environment**: you can only check SHA256 and the public-key fingerprint (`ssh-keygen -lf release-signing-key.pub`). That detects download corruption but does not prove the publisher's identity. Record "signature not verified"; never claim "signature verified".

Do not replace system components with a third-party `ssh-keygen` binary. Even if its fingerprint output matches, a replaced binary can forge the verification result.

## Release files

When downloading from GitHub Releases, get all of these:

- `project-health-macos-<version>.zip`: the skill package
- `SHA256SUMS`: the zip checksum
- `SHA256SUMS.sig`: the OpenSSH signature over `SHA256SUMS`
- `allowed_signers`: the permitted signing identity and public key
- `release-signing-key.pub`: the public key used to check the fingerprint; it matches the key in `allowed_signers`

Both the repository and the Release provide `release-signing-key.pub`.

`SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` are release assets created after the zip. They are not placed inside the zip, which avoids a recursive hash change caused by embedding the archive's own checksum.

## Signing identity

- Principal: `project-health-macos-release`
- Algorithm: Ed25519
- Public key fingerprint: `SHA256:DBDrYR50w0G+UuqtNAIgKZsXX4AjZAh3nvv0/zMCN8M`
- Public key file: `release-signing-key.pub`

Check the fingerprint before verifying:

```bash
ssh-keygen -lf release-signing-key.pub
```

## macOS verification

macOS normally bundles `shasum` but does not always provide `sha256sum`. From the download directory:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
ssh-keygen -Y verify -f allowed_signers \
  -I project-health-macos-release \
  -n file -s SHA256SUMS.sig < SHA256SUMS
```

## Linux verification

GNU coreutils distributions normally provide `sha256sum`. From the download directory:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
ssh-keygen -Y verify -f allowed_signers \
  -I project-health-macos-release \
  -n file -s SHA256SUMS.sig < SHA256SUMS
```

On macOS or Linux, both commands must succeed. A successful signature check alone is not enough; also confirm that the filename in `SHA256SUMS` matches the file you downloaded.

## Check the zip hash only

If the public key is not available yet, at least compare the hash.

macOS:

```bash
shasum -a 256 project-health-macos-<version>.zip
```

Linux:

```bash
sha256sum project-health-macos-<version>.zip
```

A matching hash proves only that the download was not corrupted. It does not prove the publisher's identity; identity verification requires `SHA256SUMS.sig`.

## Maintainer signing procedure

Keep the private key on the maintainer's machine. **Never commit it, upload it to a Release, or print it in CI logs.** For each release:

1. Sign `SHA256SUMS` with the fixed release key.
2. Generate `SHA256SUMS.sig`.
3. Upload the zip, `SHA256SUMS`, and `SHA256SUMS.sig` to the same Release.
4. Recheck the public-key fingerprint and signature verification.

When rotating the key, publish a new `release-signing-key.pub` and `allowed_signers` and record the rotation date in `CHANGELOG.md`. Old signatures remain tied to the old key; do not silently overwrite the identity.
